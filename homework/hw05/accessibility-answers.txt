1. What corrections did you have to make?
I added alt tags to the pictures, and label tags to the inputs. There was a second step in hiding the labels to prevent redundancy.

1. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?

Yes, after commenting out the CSS, the website is functionally the same. The accessability features are on the html.

1. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?

Yes



Reminder: don't forget to include a screenshot of your Wave report and link to it from your homepage!
